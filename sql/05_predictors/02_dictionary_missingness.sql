-- 05_predictors / 02_dictionary_missingness.sql
-- Final predictor dictionary and missingness tables
-- (plan tasks T11, T12, T13, T46; comments R1-7, R2-3, R2-20)
-- ============================================================================
-- Why: the reviewers ask for a predictor dictionary (source table, item id,
--   units, window), the percentage of missing values per predictor and outcome,
--   the handling of implausible values and of measurements that do not exist
--   outside the ICU (R1-7, R2-3, R2-20).
--
-- Decision applied (plan, sheet Decisiones):
--   D11 A laboratory test enters the main model only if it has a value in at
--       least 10% of the delivery hospitalizations eligible for the 24-hour
--       model (rule based on availability only, not on the outcome).  The other
--       laboratory tests and the ICU-only variables go to sensitivity analyses
--       with missingness indicators.  Creatinine carries a missingness indicator
--       in the main model (its availability depends on the outcome, Q-F4).
--       The threshold is the parameter min_coverage_pct below.
--   D12 Hemoglobin and hematocrit are strongly correlated (Q-G2b); only hemoglobin enters the main
--       model and hematocrit goes to the laboratory sensitivity analysis.
--
-- What this script creates (new name only; nothing existing is modified):
--   mimiciv.predictor_dictionary_final_v2   one row per predictor
--
-- Requires: 04_cohort_obstetric_flags.sql and 05_predictors/01_predictors_24h.sql.
-- Run the whole script (DBeaver: Alt+X), then run each query Q-G0 .. Q-G6 and share
--   only the aggregate results, never row-level data.  Percentiles are reported
--   instead of minimum and maximum values, so that no single patient's extreme value is exposed.
