-- How many deaths would a fixed follow-up horizon add?  (feasibility of Model A; R1-1, R1-6)
-- ============================================================================
-- Question: with the same-admission label there are 10 deaths (4 in delivery
--   hospitalizations).  Reviewer 1 (R1-1) accepts a later-death outcome only with
--   a justified horizon.  The WHO definition of maternal death covers up to 42 days
--   after the end of pregnancy (late maternal deaths: up to 1 year).  This script
--   COUNTS how many obstetric admissions have a recorded death within 42, 90 and
--   365 days of ADMISSION (delivery admissions are short, so admission date
--   approximates the end of pregnancy).  It changes no label and no dataset.
--
-- Two possible sources of a death date:
--   (1) mimiciv.admissions.deathtime of ANY admission of the patient (in-hospital
--       deaths, including readmissions outside the obstetric cohort);
--   (2) mimiciv.patients.dod (state records, up to 1 year after the last discharge),
--       ONLY IF that column exists in your copy.  The schema script of this project
--       (mimic_create_database.sql) creates PATIENTS without it, so Q-E0 checks it.
--
-- Interpretation caveats (to be stated in the manuscript if this outcome is used):
--   * Deaths out of hospital are only visible through dod.  Without dod the count is
--     a lower bound for the horizon outcomes.
--   * Death within a horizon is ALL-CAUSE death, not maternal-cause death.
--   * Several admissions of one patient can fall within the same horizon of one death.
--
-- Requires 03 and 04 (mimiciv.cohort_obstetric_v2).  Creates one new view
--   (mimiciv.death_events_v2).  Aggregate counts only: share the results of the count
--   queries, never row-level data.

-- Q-E0  Does patients.dod exist in this copy, and how populated is it?
