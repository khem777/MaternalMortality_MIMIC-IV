-- 06_revision_labels / 03_labels_same_admission.sql
-- Admission-level labels for the revised analysis (both models)
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose (comments R1-1, R2-1, R1-3, R2-6, R2-14, R3-*; decisions D1, D4(a),
--   D5(a) in plan v2):
--   * Model A (mortality): label = death DURING THE SAME ADMISSION
--     (admissions.hospital_expire_flag = 1), not "any recorded death of the
--     patient at any time".  deathtime IS NOT NULL is kept as a cross-check.
--   * Model B (SMM): indicators from the official CDC catalogue
--     (smm_code_patterns_v2: ICD-9-CM AND ICD-10-CM/PCS), computed per admission.
--   * Delivery flag from 02_delivery_flag.sql (is_delivery_v2).
--   Everything is created under NEW names (*_v2).  The original tables/views are
--   NOT modified.  Run order: 01 -> 02 -> 03.
--
-- UNIVERSE: the same universe as the original SMM script -- female, approx. age
--   12-55 (anchor_age + admission year - anchor_year), at least one diagnosis in
--   mimiciv.pregnancy_diagnoses_expanded, ANY diagnosis position.
--   The diagnosis-position rule (<=4 vs none, task T44) differs between the two
--   original cohort scripts and is resolved in the next script (04), after both
--   are reconciled.  This script therefore only labels; it does not define the
--   final cohort.
--
-- Nothing here writes subject_id/hadm_id outside the database.  The count
-- queries at the end return aggregates only -- share those, never row-level data.
