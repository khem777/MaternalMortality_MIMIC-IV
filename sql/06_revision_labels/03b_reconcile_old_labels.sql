-- Reconcile the SMM label of the SUBMITTED dataset with the original view
-- ============================================================================
-- Why: before the response letter says "from 475 to 848", the 475 SMM admissions
--   of the submitted dataset (mimiciv.cohort_smm_dataset, outcome_smm = 1) must be
--   reconciled with the original view (mimiciv.hadm_with_smm) and with the new
--   label.  Q-C4 splits the two lists into 459 admissions in both, 389 only in the
--   official list and 16 only in the original one (original = 459 + 16 = 475).
--   Result (Q23, revision_audit_counts.md): all 475 positives of the dataset come
--   from the original view (459 also in the new label, 16 only in the original),
--   so there is no gap between the dataset and the view to explain.  (An earlier
--   version of this note read "405 admissions (389 + 16)" and a 70-admission gap;
--   that was an arithmetic slip, corrected on 2026-10-25.)
--   Read-only: SELECTs only, aggregate counts only.
