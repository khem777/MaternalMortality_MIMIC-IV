-- ============================================================================
-- REVISION AUDIT, PART 2 (Healthcare, healthcare-4661619) -- READ-ONLY
-- ============================================================================
-- Follow-up to audit_counts.sql after the first results (Q1-Q11). Same rules:
-- only temporary tables + SELECTs, aggregated output, never publish subject_id/hadm_id.
--   Q15  SMM cases by indicator group, overall and in delivery hospitalizations
--   Q16  profile of the in-hospital deaths of the same admission (small aggregated cells)
--   Q17  approximate admission year (lower bound of the anchor window + offset) vs. ICD version (anchor_year_group is
--        the patient's anchor window, NOT the date of each admission)
--   Q18  SMM cases per indicator group and anchor_year_group (what drives the rise per era)
-- Prerequisites: mimiciv.cohort_smm_dataset, mimiciv.hadm_with_smm,
--                mimiciv.hadm_delivery_hospitalization, mimiciv.pregnancy_diagnoses_expanded
