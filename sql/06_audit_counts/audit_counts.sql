-- ============================================================================
-- REVISION AUDIT -- counts requested by the reviewers (Healthcare, healthcare-4661619)
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: measure, on the data the submitted models were trained on, the numbers
-- the reviewers ask for and that the manuscript does not report. READ-ONLY: it only
-- creates temporary tables and runs SELECTs. No patient-level output is produced
-- except aggregated counts; do NOT publish result rows that list subject_id/hadm_id.
--
-- Prerequisites (already built for the submitted analyses):
--   mimiciv.cohort_maternal        (Model A table; column `outcome`)
--   mimiciv.cohort_smm_dataset     (Model B table; columns outcome_smm, is_delivery_hospitalization,
--                                   icu_stay, heart_rate, creatine, lactic_acid, ...; the column is spelled `creatine`, as in the table)
--   mimiciv.pregnancy_diagnoses_expanded (view)
-- Run the whole script (DBeaver: Alt+X) and copy each result set into the
-- 'Conteos' sheet of Plan_Correcciones_Maternal_Healthcare.xlsx.
-- Each result set starts with a label column `q`.
