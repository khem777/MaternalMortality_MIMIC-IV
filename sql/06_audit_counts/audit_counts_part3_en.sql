-- REVISION AUDIT, PART 3 (Healthcare, healthcare-4661619) -- READ-ONLY
-- ============================================================================
-- Follow-up to Q15/Q16: 47% of the SMM admissions are NOT delivery hospitalizations and
-- acute renal failure is the largest indicator. These queries measure how much the
-- SMM label depends on (a) non-delivery admissions and (b) the renal indicator, and
-- what the non-delivery admissions are. Aggregated output only.
--   Q19  number of distinct SMM indicators per SMM admission, delivery vs non-delivery
--   Q20  alternative SMM definitions: admissions / patients / ICU / ICD-10 deliveries
--   Q21  obstetric code chapters present in non-delivery SMM admissions
-- Prerequisites: mimiciv.cohort_smm_dataset, mimiciv.hadm_with_smm
