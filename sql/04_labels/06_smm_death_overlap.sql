-- Overlap between severe maternal morbidity (revised label) and death in the
-- same admission (plan task T08; comment R1-9)
-- ============================================================================
-- Why: Reviewer 1 (R1-9) asks how severe maternal morbidity (SMM) relates to
--   maternal mortality.  The earlier count (Q10) used the SUBMITTED SMM label.
--   This script repeats it with the revised labels (CDC list, ICD-9-CM and
--   ICD-10-CM/PCS; death = hospital_expire_flag in the same admission) and in
--   the three scopes used in the revised analysis, so the supplement can state
--   exactly how many deaths carry an SMM indicator and how many SMM admissions
--   end in death.
--
-- What it does: only reads.  It creates no table or view and changes no label.
--   Requires mimiciv.predictors_24h_v2 (05_predictors/01_predictors_24h.sql).
--   Aggregate counts only -- share the results of the four queries, never rows.
