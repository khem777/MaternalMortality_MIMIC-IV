-- Diagnosis-position rule and cohort definition (plan task T44; comments R2-14, R1-5)
-- ============================================================================
-- Problem: the manuscript says an admission enters the cohort when it has an
--   obstetric diagnosis in position <= 4, but the SQL that built both datasets
--   has NO position restriction.  The previous audit (Q12) showed the rule
--   matters: it would remove 162 admissions, 18 SMM cases and 3 of the 10
--   same-admission deaths.  Before choosing a rule we need to know WHICH
--   admissions it removes and what kind of obstetric code they carry.
--
-- What this script does (decision-neutral: it does NOT pick the rule):
--   1. Adds, per admission of the obstetric universe, the obstetric-diagnosis
--      features needed to apply ANY of the candidate rules with a WHERE clause:
--      lowest diagnosis position, number of obstetric diagnoses, whether any
--      obstetric diagnosis is a STRUCTURED code (ICD-10 chapter O, Z33/Z34/Z37/Z39,
--      ICD-9 630-679, ICD-9 V22-V28) or only a TEXT match on the long title
--      (e.g. "weeks of gestation", "pregnancy test"), ICU stay flag.
--   2. Returns aggregate counts only (Q-D1 .. Q-D5) so that you and I can choose
--      the rule with data (decision D6) and write it into Methods.
--
-- Run order: 01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 04.  Everything is created under NEW names (*_v2);
--   no existing table or view is modified.  Share only the aggregate results of
--   the count queries, never row-level data.
