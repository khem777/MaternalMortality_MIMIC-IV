-- ============================================================================
-- EXPANDED MATERNAL COHORT -- candidates to increase the N of deaths
-- ============================================================================
-- English version. Spanish original: maternal_cohort_expanded_es.sql (kept in
-- this same folder). Object names below are the English names this project
-- uses going forward -- see docs/NAMING.md for the full Spanish -> English
-- mapping applied across the whole project.
--
-- Goal: expand the original cohort (23,474 / 23,471 / 36 deaths, defined in
-- docs/Cohort de embarazadas.txt) by applying 3 of the 4 levers discussed
-- while debugging the neonatal cohort. The 4th (a composite "near-miss"
-- outcome) is handled separately -- see sql/03_cohort_smm/smm_cohort_en.sql
-- -- because it changes the research question and needed its own agreed-upon
-- indicator list.
--
-- Levers applied here:
--   (1) Drop the mandatory JOIN with icustays -> use EVERY hospital
--       admission (hosp module), not only ones that went through the ICU.
--       An "had_icu_stay" flag is kept so this can still be filtered/
--       compared afterward.
--   (2) Drop the 2021-10 to 2022-10 date restriction (inherited from the
--       neonatal model, with no known justification for the maternal
--       cohort). Left as an optional, commented-out filter in case your
--       MIMIC-IV demo/access environment only has data in a certain range.
--   (3) Expand obstetric-diagnosis detection: in addition to the ILIKE text
--       match (PREGNANCY/OBSTETRIC/FETAL/DELIVERY), also match by ICD
--       chapter/range (ICD-9: 630-679, V22-V24, V27, V28; ICD-10: chapter
--       O00-O9A, Z33/Z34/Z37/Z39), which can catch obstetric codes whose
--       long title doesn't contain those words.
--
-- IMPORTANT NOTE: this script has NOT been run against the real database
-- yet (localhost:5433, only reachable from Emmanuel's machine). Run it
-- yourself in pgAdmin/psql and share the resulting counts before deciding
-- the next step.
--
-- KNOWN POSSIBLE BUG to check in the original exploratory script: the
-- condition "TO_CHAR(a.admittime,'YYYYMM') <= '221410'" has month '14',
-- which doesn't exist. It was probably meant to be '221031' (31-Oct-2022).
-- It no longer applies here because the date filter was removed, but if
-- you re-enable it, double check that value.
--
-- CORRECTION (v2, from Emmanuel's own finding): the PATIENTS table in this
-- schema defines `dob` explicitly as "This is a NaN column" (see
-- sql/01_load_mimic_iv_schema/mimic_create_database.sql) -- it was only
-- ever populated for the cases the neonatal pipeline updated with a
-- synthetic "baby's date of birth", not as a real demographic field for
-- each adult patient. Using it to compute the mother's age filters the
-- cohort incorrectly (that's why removing the age BETWEEN filter alone
-- jumped the count from 36 to 45: it stopped wrongly excluding mothers
-- whose `dob` was never populated).
--
-- The correct way to estimate age in MIMIC-IV is ANCHOR_AGE / ANCHOR_YEAR
-- (populated for every patient -- it's MIMIC-IV's official
-- de-identification mechanism): ANCHOR_AGE is the patient's age during
-- ANCHOR_YEAR, and every date for that patient is shifted consistently
-- relative to that year. So:
--   age_at_admission = anchor_age + (year(admittime) - anchor_year)
-- (Known limitation: patients who were ever older than 89 are capped at
-- anchor_age = 91 for de-identification; this doesn't meaningfully affect
-- the 12-55 range we care about here.)
